The steps involved for aim 1 include,

 - Calculate the AQI of the city.
 - Segregate the AQI of the cities in to groups based on some threshold.
 - Based on each group set the probable disease that can occur in the respective city.

The data set we have used has hourly and daily air quality data of different stations in India. The AQI calculation used seven measures PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx, NH3, CO and O3. For cities with insufficient pollutant data, the final AQI is calculated based on at least one of PM2.5 and PM10 and at least three of the seven available pollutants. For cities with insufficient data, hourly wise data had been scrapped from the Central Control Room for Air Quality Management web page as mentioned in the dataset section. Corresponding to the hourly AQI data, the prominent pollutant responsible for the AQI value was also retained. From reference, the hourly, station wise data had been calculated by considering the running average of the AQI value for each pollutant over the past 24 hours (past 8 hours for CO and O3) with the condition of having at least 16 values over the past 24 hours data. The values are then averaged over a day and across all stations within a city to produce the daily wise AQI value for a particular city. Furtheromre, for every daily wise AQI per city a corresponding prominent pollutant was noted down if the pollutant appeared the maximum number of times in the 24 hours of the day (i.e. the prominent pollutant is the mode across the hourly data for the city on a particular day). The daily, city wise data was then averaged over a period of one month to find the average AQI for the month with a condition of having atleast 15 days worth of data. The corresponding prominent pollutant was also founf using the aforementioned process over a time period of one month. The data was then segregated into groups on the basis of AQI over a threshold for which the general population in each group suffers from a set symptoms as shown in table 1. Based on these thresholds we then found a set of probable diseases in each city corresponding to the AQI value and the prominent pollutant.
