In this aim we have taken covid cases data from https://api.covid19india.org/ .Then,we processed it and found out the total covid cases for each week for each of the city.Then,for that week we also found the average AQI of the corresponding week and plotted out the data to visualize the relationship between AQI and Covid cases.According,to the data behaviour and studying the values for each of the city we will apply one of the correlation test from available tests like Pearson,Kendall-Tau and spearman tests.These tests will give us the correlation values between -1 and 1 and we can easily infer about how strong the relationsip between AQI and Covid cases.
